I'd never actually eaten challah before, but it looks cool and I heard you can use the leftovers for amazing french toast. 

I chose [this recipe][challah-recipe] from King Arthur Flour because their recipes include ingredients by weight in addition to volume. Once I discovered that you can get a decent kitchen scale for about $10, baking became way easier for me. 

Rolling out the dough for the final shaping was a challenge. The dough didn't want to stretch, and every time I let go it would recompress. I ended up fighting with it for a while and then letting it sit while I googled if there was a better way -- turns out that you can let the dough sit for a few minutes and it chills out and lets you stretch it way better.

The four-stranded braid looked challenging at first but after staring at the pictures [here][challah-blog] I figured out the pattern. A few notes about that:

* Pick one of the outermost strands, it does not matter but you will alternate. I'm calling this the "active strand".
* Move the "acive" strand over the two inner strands
* Then move the "active" strand back under the nearest of the two inner strands

Then, take the other outermost strand and do the same thing. (It's easier with pictures, but I'm lazy.) 

I've heard of five and even six braided challah, perhaps I'll make them one day.
