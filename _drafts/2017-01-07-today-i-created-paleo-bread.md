This is a recipe that I have actually created a lot of times, for almost a few years now. This was before I became interested in creating yeast breads. Some friends discovered that if you use sunflower butter instead of almond butter, the bread will turn green. 

This is epically awesome. Unfortunately, I learned that you can get more of a reaction if you have more vinegar than baking soda, but the sunbutter-green reaction only happens in a basic environment. My recipe used 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1/2 tsp baking soda, so I decided to invert that ratio (and then I decided to use a tablespoon of vinegar because I saw another recipe with that ratio and the worst thing that could happen would be exploding nut butters which honestly seems kind of fun.) 

It turns out, if you do this, in the last half of baking the center of the bread will become a very minor bread volcano. No batter fell over the sides, but since the ends of the bread had set already I ended up with two stubby slices on the ends and taller pieces in the rest of the loaf.
