I've heard that bread is difficult. People have told me that they have had trouble getting bread to rise, and that I'm going to fail a lot in attempting to create it. This hasn't been my experience so far so I wanted to reflect a bit on my experience learning how to create bread. 

The first bread I created by myself was a no-knead recipe. There are like a million of these, I picked a basic one that just used flour, water, salt, and yeast. Four is about the number of ingredients I can remember at any given time so I found the simple bread formula was a good fit. Most no-knead recipes tell you to bake the bread in a dutch oven, which I didn't have at the time so I googled "no knead bread in a pan" and watched a Canadian dude on YouTube tell me how to do it. 

Since then I've created a variety of breads, like [King Arthur Flour's Hearth Bread][hearth_bread], challah, sourdough, [this pumpkin yeast bread recipe][pumpkin_bread], a [fast-rising English muffin toasting bread][english_muffin_bread], and crumpets. My main resources have been [King Arthur Flour][king_arthur_flour], and a book called The Bread Baker's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart. I recommend both, but King Arthur Flour is more newcomer-friendly; Bread Baker's Apprentice is the kind of book where most of the recipes take two or three days to complete, and the recipes expect you to have read the preceding 100 pages of theory. It's great if you want to learn the ways of breadcraft, but I don't recommend starting out on that path.  

I like the idea that I'm somehow a bread genius and this is why my experiments have generally been successful, but I know that I'm new to the hobby and I have a lot still to learn. I think my bread adventure has potentially gone more smoothly than others' due to two factors.  

Things I did differently than others may have:

* First, I measure ingredients with a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups. I learned from somewhere that measuring by volume is imprecise because it's dependent on how hard you scoop and how much water the flour has absorbed from the air on any given day. You can get a basic kitchen scale from Amazon for $10. It's small and I keep it in a drawer when I'm not using it.

* Next, I bought an instant-read thermometer. How do you know the bread is done? Well, you can estimate by looking at how brown the crust is, or try to gauge whether or not the loaf sounds sufficiently hollow when you rap on the bottom. You could try to scry into the bread, or commune with the bread spirits. Or you can stick a thermometer into the bread and check that it's the temperature that the recipe says it should be. 

If the recipe doesn't list an internal temperature it's a crappy recipe, find a different one. (I've found that plain flour-water-yeast-salt breads should be about 205 F, and breads with sugar, milk, eggs, or other extra stuff should be about 190 F. This is approximate, don't quote this, I have done only haphazard science to confirm this fact.)

* Bonus item: I also bought a Danish whisk. I did not need one of these, but it looked like a wizard's tool and I wanted to be a bread wizard.

![Danish whisk][danish_whisk]

Things I did not need to buy because I already had them:

* mixing bowl
  * I have three of varying sizes, could make do with 2 or even 1. 
* loaf pan 
* measuring spoons
  * my scale is not precise enough to measure 1 gram of yeast, and a lot of recipes list small things like yeast and salt in volume measurements still
* oven
  * my oven is tiny. 

Things I acquired later because I wanted them:

* silpat mat for kneading
  * this is a silicon mat that you can deploy on a table or counter so your significant other doesn't get upset that you got flour or oil all over the table and didn't clean it up. 
* 6L clear bucket to let the dough rise
  * it's sometimes hard to tell how much dough has risen if you let it proof in a mixing bowl because the bowl is smaller in diameter at the bottom. 
  * I think I might actually prefer a smaller bucket, perhaps 4L with a smaller diamater since 2L/4L/6L is still a bit tough to be precise
* tupperware to put different flours in
* 4 loaf pans (two 8.5x4.5, two 9x5)
  * I got tired of only having one size of pan, so I initially got one of each size, and then I got a second of each size because there are recipes that make two loaves and I want my loaves to match. 
* bench scraper
  * divide dough into smaller pieces
  * you can use the back of a knife for this, but if you do it a lot it's easier to use because you can exert force straight down instead of through the knife handle.
* $6 oven thermometer (it hangs on your oven rack, rather than having a probe that you stick into the substance you're measuring). 
  * After overbaking my challah a little bit, I decided to get a second opinion. It turns out my oven lies to me a lot: it lies about being preheated, and it sometimes gets hotter than it says it is.
